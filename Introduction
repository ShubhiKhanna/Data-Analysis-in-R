R five basic data types: Logical, Integer, Numeric, Character, and Complex

Logical: TRUE or FALSE (T or F).
Integer: 125L, 2L, and 10L (numbers are following by L to indicate they are integers).
Numeric: 12.5, 0.0314, 0.00099, and 9.9e-3 (the scientific notation is allowed using the letter e or E).
Character: "Hello", "12.5", "Apple" and "T" (Characters are wrapped in quotes or appostrophes).

ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
Multiplication: 5 * 5
Division: 5 / 5
Addition: 5 + 5
Subtraction: 5 - 5
Concepts
A literal value is any part of a statement or expression that is to be used exactly as it's meant to be interpreted.

R is case-sensitive, i.e., it makes a difference between upper and lower cases: for example,
TRUE
,
FALSE
,
T
, and
F
are the only authorized logical literals.

R allows only one instruction (a valid line) per line of code, e.g., if you enter two logical literals on the same line, you will get an error.
